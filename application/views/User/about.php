                            <p>Having been a standalone field for a long time, the software industry has now come neck to neck with most of the other industries by close coordination and easy integration. From the smallest light bulb to the most massive aircrafts, every industry is now implementing the use of computer programming for the convenience of the end user. A good command over coding can thus open a wide variety of employment opportunities. </p>

Coding is the most in-demand skill of the twenty first century. People known to possess this skill command the world and are often more successful than their peers. Many people think coding can be mastered only by geniuses who have some supernatural intelligence levels but I must tell you, you donâ€™t need to be a genius to learn how to code; only determination is required. Wishing you success and achievement in your career.</p>

                            Along with training students with the latest technologies and programming languages, we also connect them to software companies via our placement assistance program. This program includes practicing a lot of interview problems and mock interviews conducted by company representatives.
